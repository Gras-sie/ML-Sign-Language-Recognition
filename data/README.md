# Data Folder

This folder is used to store the ASL Alphabet dataset for training and testing the model.

**Note:** The dataset is not included in the repository due to its size. Please download the ASL Alphabet dataset from Kaggle and extract it here.

## Download Instructions

2. Download the dataset manually or use the Kaggle API:
   ```bash

3. Extract the contents into this `data/` folder so it contains subfolders for each letter (A, B, C, ...).
